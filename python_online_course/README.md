Homework Version: 1.0

Each directory within this folder corresponds to a distinct homework problem. 
To work on a homework problem, start a Jupyter notebook server, and navigate
to that problem's directory in Jupyter's file-viewer. The homework problem
is described in full in the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file). You are to
write your solution in that notebook. 

An automated grader will evaluate your code in the notebook. If all of its tests are passed, 
a hash (a long string of random characters) will be printed out. Paste this hash 
into the appropriate field on the BWSI EdX page, and you will be given credit 
for the problem. There is no limit to the number of times that you run the grader.

The following are brief descriptions of each problem, along with a list of the 
essential concepts required for the concept, as found in the "Python Like You
Mean It" website: https://rsokl.github.io/Learning_Python/

# Is it a palindrome? 

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

Write code that takes a string and returns `True` if that string is a palindrome. Your analysis should be case-insensitive and should disregard spaces. E.g. "Race car" should be considered a palindrome, despite beginning with a capitalized letter and containing a space. None of the strings will contain punctuation. Thus your function should produce the following behavior: 

- "Are we not drawn onward to new era" -> True
- "batman" -> False 

## Required Concepts
Basic Object Types
- strings
- checking equality

Sequence Types
- slicing

# Pizza Shop
You work at a pizza restaurant, which is starting to accept orders online. You need to
provide a python function that will accept an arbitrary order as its arguments, 
and compute the correct price for the order.

## Required Concepts
Basic Object Types

For-Loops and While-Loops
- basic use of for-loops and/or iterables

Basics of Functions
- functions
  - passing a function an arbitrary number of positional arguments
  - specifying default values for arguments
- dictionaries would be useful here
