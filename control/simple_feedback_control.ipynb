    "# Practicing Feedback Control\n",

    "## Simple Slide Camera\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a camera attached to a cart that is allowed to slide along a 1-dimensional track. The track is elevated some height $h$ above the ground and the camera is pointing downward. There is some target on the ground that the camera can observe; more specifically the camera can measure the angle $-\\pi /2 < \\gamma < \\pi/2$ from the centerline of the camera to the target. The objective is to issue velocity commands, $v_{cmd}$, in order to move the cart to a position such that $\\gamma \\rightarrow \\gamma_{des}$ (e.g. if $\\gamma_{des} = 0$, then the objective is simply to move the cart directly over the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "This system is depicted in the below diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/simple_slide_camera.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This somewhat contrived system can be thought of as a highly simplified model of the quadrotor and it's downward-facing camera. If the quadrotor is constrained to move in one dimension, can be controlled via velocity commands, and we ignore the pitch that is induced when changing velocity (valid assumption for low-acceleration maneuvers), then we can roughly model the quadrotor as this simple slide camera\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the position of the cart, $x$, and position of the target $x_{des}$ are not directly measured, only $\\gamma$ is measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will provide the code necessary to simulate this system"

    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Does your gamma error (i.e. output converge to 0.0? \n",
    "    - If so how quickly (i.e. how long does it take for the error to be 5% of the original error)\n",
    "    - If not, what is happening? Is the error never changing or is it oscillating back and forth across zero? Can you change the proportional gain kp to change this behavior?\n",
    "2. What values should your system's position and velocity be converging upon? Since this is a practice problem and we want to gain understanding of how this system behaves, we've cheated and let you observe the position and velocity of the system which were meant to be unobservable in the real world. Are the position and velocity converging to values you expected?\n",
    "3. As you increase the proportional gain, what happens to the rate at which the error converges to zero? \n",
    "    - Can you find a proportional gain that converges within 1 second (i.e error reaches 5% of it's original value)?\n",
    "4. Do you think there is such a thing as a proportional gain being too large? What could be some possible effects of setting your gain too high?\n",
    "    - Try it out: find gain that \"breaks\" the nice behavior of the system. What is the approximate value of that \"threshold\" gain? What is happening to the system when you set the gain higher than that threshold? Can you explain why it's behaving as it is? \n",
    "    - Keeping the gain above this threshold, is there anything you could change that would fix this behavior? Is this change always possible in the real world; why or why not?\n",
    "5. What happens if you cannot perfectly control the velocity, for example there is some form of velocity disturbance that you cannot control (e.g. wind)? Let's try it out:\n",
    "    - in the ACTUATOR portion of the simulation script, replace `actuate_velocity_command` with `actuate_disturbed_velocity_command`, restart the kernel, and run the script. Does output error (gamma error) still converge to zero? If not, what does the gamma error converge to? How might you change your controller to fix this \"steady state error\"\n",
    "6. Often times we control a system by applying a force. In this way we are not directly controlling the velocity of a system, but instead the acceleration. Let's try it out:\n",
    "    - in the ACTUATOR portion of the simulation script replace `actuate_velocity_command` with `actuate_acceleration_command`. In the CONTROLLER portion of the script, have the controller output a acc_cmd instead of vel_cmd (just change the variable name, but this way you know it represents an acceleration instead of a velocity). Restart the kernel and rerun the script\n",
    "    - Now what is happening to the gamma error, is it converging to zero? If not, is there anything you could think of to change in you controller in order to converge the error to zero?"
